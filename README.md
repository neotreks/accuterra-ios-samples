Sample apps for iOS built with the AccuTerra SDK

These sample apps are provided to demonstrate the capabilities of the AccuTerra Maps SDK. 

To run these apps, you will need Cocoapods installed. See the instructions here for more [details](https://sdk.accuterra.com/develop/ios-sdk-home/ios-getting-started/) if you need help with Cocoapods. Otherwise, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repo
2. In a terminal, "cd" to the directory containing the sample of interest. This will contain the project file, workspace, and Podfile
3. Type the following Cocoapods command:
```
pod install
```
4. Open the workspace file (not the project file)
5. Obtain access tokens from NeoTreks to run the sample applications - (here) [https://sdk.accuterra.com/latest/api-keys/]
5. Set the Access Tokens and Service URL in the info.plist file from the directions on this: (page) [https://sdk.accuterra.com/latest/api-keys/]
6. Launch the target application and you should see the demostrated functionality.
